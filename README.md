# U-Net and Weak Supervision for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Survival Forecasting
Enhancing glioma tumor segmentation and survival analysis

- Developed and fine-tuned a U-Net model, achieving 63\% validation accuracy and 66% IoU on T2-weighted MRI images, enhancing glioma tumor segmentation. Implemented Test-Time Augmentation, boosting T2 class IoU by 5.1% to 66.31%.
- Fine-tuned Simple and Attention models for predicting two-year survival of brain tumor patients, achieving 86.8% accuracy for the Simple model and 84.4% for the Attention model. Utilized Monte Carlo Dropout to assess prediction uncertainty.
